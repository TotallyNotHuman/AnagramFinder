AnagramFinder
=============

Locates anagrams of a word in a pre-constructed index. This software is broken down into two primary components: the index builder and the search frontend itself.

Index builder
-------------

The index builder takes in a file of words delimited by `\n`. It then generates a non-unique identifier (calling it a hash is technically wrong as anagrams will produce the same identifier) and populates a dictionary with it, then serializes the dictionary into a file for use with the search frontend.

In its current iteration it is able to construct an index from 370k words in 3.04 seconds (121.71 kword/s) on average (across 5 runs). There is most likely still room for improvement.

Search frontend
---------------
